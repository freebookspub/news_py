Its anchor tenant, Neiman Marcus, filed for bankruptcy and closed permanently, and at least four other stores, as well as several restaurants, have also gone out of business.</p>, <p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">The development\\u2019s centerpiece, the 150-foot-tall scalable structure known as the Vessel, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/nyregion/hudson-yards-suicide-vessel.html\" title=\"\">closed to visitors in January</a> after a third suicide in less than a year. The office buildings, whose workers sustained many of the shops and restaurants, have been largely empty since last spring.</p>, <p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Even more perilous, the promised second phase of Hudson Yards \\u2014 eight additional buildings, including a school, more luxury condos and office space \\u2014 appears on indefinite hold as the developer, the Related Companies, seeks federal financing for a nearly 10-acre platform on which it will be built.</p>, <p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Related, which had said the entire project would be finished in 2024, no longer offers an estimated completion date.</p>, <p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">The project\\u2019s woes are in many ways a microcosm of the broader challenges facing the city as it tries to recover.</p>, <p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Related said it was counting on wealthy buyers filling its condos and deep-pocketed customers packing the mall to make Hudson Yards financially viable.</p>, <p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">But that was before the coronavirus arrived in New York.</p>, <p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">With the pandemic forcing white-collar workers to stay home \\u2014 and keeping foreign buyers and tourists away \\u2014 it is not clear when, or if, demand will reignite for the vast supply of upscale aeries and blue-chip office space crowding the city\\u2019s skyline.</p>, <p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">\\u201cThe challenges facing Hudson Yards aren\\u2019t unique,\\u201d said Danny Ismail, an analyst and lead of office coverage for the real estate research firm Green Street Advisors. \\u201cAll commercial real estate in New York City has been impacted by Covid-19. However, I would argue that post-pandemic, Hudson Yards and the area around it will be one of the better office markets in New York City.\\u201d</p>, <p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">The creation of Hudson Yards capped nearly 30 years of planning for the last large, undeveloped parcel in Manhattan, industrial land between Pennsylvania Station and the Hudson River.</p>, <p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">It is New York\\u2019s largest public-private venture and the city\\u2019s biggest development since Rockefeller Center in the 1930s, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/09/nyregion/hudson-yards-new-york-tax-breaks.html\" title=\"\">aided by roughly $6 billion in tax breaks and other government assistance</a>, including the expansion of the subway to the West Side. Even with the subway expansion, Hudson Yards is still relatively isolated from the rest of Manhattan, off the beaten path from the busiest avenues for tourists, shoppers and workers.</p>, <p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Related acknowledged that it was facing the same financial problems as the rest of the city, but said tenants were still moving into the project\\u2019s office buildings and that Hudson Yards would eventually rebound.</p>, <p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Four office buildings at Hudson Yards \\u2014 including 50 Hudson Yards, which is under construction \\u2014 are 93 percent leased, a spokesman for Related said, though it is unclear how much of that occurred last year. Facebook signed a lease in late 2019 for roughly 1.5 million square feet.</p>, <p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">\\u201cOur strong office leasing, even during the pandemic, is why we\\u2019re well positioned to lead New York\\u2019s comeback from Covid and why the adjacent neighborhoods and the entire West Side will recover faster,\\u201d the spokesman, Jon Weinstein, said.</p>, <p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Still, the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/realestate/how-will-hudson-yards-survive-the-pandemic.html\" title=\"\">troubles confronting Hudson Yards</a> have caused Related to rethink its plans.</p>, <p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Led by its billionaire founder Stephen M. Ross, the company set out to build Hudson Yards in two phases. The first phase, which opened in 2019, has four office towers, two residential buildings, a hotel and the mall.</p>, <p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">The second part was supposed to include 3,000 residences across eight buildings closer to the Hudson River, as well as a 750-seat public school and hundreds of low-cost rental units. At least 265 apartments are meant to be \\u201cpermanently affordable,\\u201d <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/22/nyregion/22hudson.html\" title=\"\">according to a 2009 agreement</a> between City Hall and Related.</p>, <p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">In total, Hudson Yards was expected to stretch 28 acres over existing rail yards and encompass 18 million square feet of space, roughly double the size of downtown Phoenix.</p>, <p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">The developer has considered an array of new options, including even a casino, though that idea is no longer front and center, according to Mr. Weinstein.</p>, <p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Related cannot construct the second half until it builds a deck over the rail yard.

Its anchor tenant, Neiman Marcus, filed for bankruptcy and closed permanently, and at least four other stores, as well as several restaurants, have also gone out of business.\", \"The development’s centerpiece, the 150-foot-tall scalable structure known as the Vessel, closed to visitors in January after a third suicide in less than a year. The office buildings, whose workers sustained many of the shops and restaurants, have been largely empty since last spring.\", \"Even more perilous, the promised second phase of Hudson Yards — eight additional buildings, including a school, more luxury condos and office space — appears on indefinite hold as the developer, the Related Companies, seeks federal financing for a nearly 10-acre platform on which it will be built.\", \"Related, which had said the entire project would be finished in 2024, no longer offers an estimated completion date.\", \"The project’s woes are in many ways a microcosm of the broader challenges facing the city as it tries to recover.\", \"Related said it was counting on wealthy buyers filling its condos and deep-pocketed customers packing the mall to make Hudson Yards financially viable.\", \"But that was before the coronavirus arrived in New York.\", \"With the pandemic forcing white-collar workers to stay home — and keeping foreign buyers and tourists away — it is not clear when, or if, demand will reignite for the vast supply of upscale aeries and blue-chip office space crowding the city’s skyline.\", \"“The challenges facing Hudson Yards aren’t unique,” said Danny Ismail, an analyst and lead of office coverage for the real estate research firm Green Street Advisors. “All commercial real estate in New York City has been impacted by Covid-19. However, I would argue that post-pandemic, Hudson Yards and the area around it will be one of the better office markets in New York City.”\", \"The creation of Hudson Yards capped nearly 30 years of planning for the last large, undeveloped parcel in Manhattan, industrial land between Pennsylvania Station and the Hudson River.\", \"It is New York’s largest public-private venture and the city’s biggest development since Rockefeller Center in the 1930s, aided by roughly $6 billion in tax breaks and other government assistance, including the expansion of the subway to the West Side. Even with the subway expansion, Hudson Yards is still relatively isolated from the rest of Manhattan, off the beaten path from the busiest avenues for tourists, shoppers and workers.\", \"Related acknowledged that it was facing the same financial problems as the rest of the city, but said tenants were still moving into the project’s office buildings and that Hudson Yards would eventually rebound.\", \"Four office buildings at Hudson Yards — including 50 Hudson Yards, which is under construction — are 93 percent leased, a spokesman for Related said, though it is unclear how much of that occurred last year. Facebook signed a lease in late 2019 for roughly 1.5 million square feet.\", \"“Our strong office leasing, even during the pandemic, is why we’re well positioned to lead New York’s comeback from Covid and why the adjacent neighborhoods and the entire West Side will recover faster,” the spokesman, Jon Weinstein, said.\", \"Still, the troubles confronting Hudson Yards have caused Related to rethink its plans.\", \"Led by its billionaire founder Stephen M. Ross, the company set out to build Hudson Yards in two phases. The first phase, which opened in 2019, has four office towers, two residential buildings, a hotel and the mall.\", \"The second part was supposed to include 3,000 residences across eight buildings closer to the Hudson River, as well as a 750-seat public school and hundreds of low-cost rental units. At least 265 apartments are meant to be “permanently affordable,” according to a 2009 agreement between City Hall and Related.\", \"In total, Hudson Yards was expected to stretch 28 acres over existing rail yards and encompass 18 million square feet of space, roughly double the size of downtown Phoenix.\", \"The developer has considered an array of new options, including even a casino, though that idea is no longer front and center, according to Mr. Weinstein.\", \"Related cannot construct the second half until it builds a deck over the rail yard.

I think it’s good to say when we’ve done something wrong.”\", \"But hours before, she had sounded a different tone.\", \"“I woke up early this morning literally laughing thinking about what a bunch of morons the Democrats (+11) are for giving some one like me free time,” she wrote on Twitter. “In this Democrat tyrannical government, Conservative Republicans have no say on committees anyway. Oh this is going to be fun!”\"]');
